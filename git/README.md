# git cheat-sheet
Just another Git cheat sheet repo here in [this markdown file](./simple.git.md)!

---
#### I created this repo while reviewing my knowledge of the basic `git` commands alongside watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apGV9Kg7ics) **`git`** tutorial.

*There are multiple commits here to remind me what I have done while coming back to this project. So I gotta say "Hi!" to the future me!*
